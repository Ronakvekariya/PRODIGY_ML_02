# Description :
- Market Basket Analysis
- Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique used to discover patterns or associations between items in large datasets. It is commonly used in retail to identify sets of products that frequently co-occur in transactions.
- Here The data of a mall is given consist of customer featuer such as age , gender . annual income and spending sccore
- Task is to the cluster the customer into group based on their purchasing history and behaviour to target the customer and strategize for maximum profit.

  # Alogirithm :-
  - K-Means algorithm
  - cluser size = 2
 
  # Experience :-
 - Key Learnings
    1. Cluster Formation: Understand how data points form natural clusters based on their features.
    2. Centroid Calculation: Learn how the algorithm iteratively refines cluster centroids to minimize within-cluster variance.
    3. Convergence: Observe the convergence process, where the algorithm iteratively improves cluster quality.
    4. Distance Metrics: Gain insights into different distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean) and their impact on clustering results.
